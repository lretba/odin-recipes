    <h2>Why muesli?</h2>
    <p>Most people think that muesli sucks. This is because theirs does. But your muesli does not have to be as disgusting as other peoples muesli!</p>
    <p>The best part about muesli is that it is basically a blank canvas. You choose what you want to express, and how the ingredients you select combine to an idea.</p>
    <p><strong>Muesli is fantastic for bulking, but avoid it if you want to lose weight.</strong> My version is packed with protein and fiber, but it is definitely not a meal that is low in calories.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><sub>From Wikipedia:</sub>Muesli (/ˈmjuːzli/ MEWZ-lee[1][2]) is a cold Swiss breakfast dish, the primary ingredient of which is rolled oats. Traditionally, it is set to soak overnight and eaten the next morning. Additional ingredients, such as grains, nuts, seeds, and fresh or dried fruits are sometimes added, along with milk or cream, a small amount of citrus juice, and honey to add sweetness.[3] Yoghurt, other milk products, or milk substitutes are now commonly added to both homemade and commercially packaged muesli recipes.</p>
    <p>Or you simply ignore the above mentioned ingredients and think of muesli as a blank canvas. Something needs to hold the composition together, and that is usually some kind of grain, but you do you! We love oats though. They are good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>30g oats or any other type of grain you would prefer</li>
        <li>30g soy flakes</li>
        <li>10g walnuts</li>
        <li>10g pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>10g hemp seeds</li>
        <li>10g dried apricot, cut (or any other dried fruit that you like!)</li>
        <li>60g fresh berries (whatever is in season!)</li>
        <li>100g fruit (anything, really. Just make sure that it is washed and nicely cut up in bite-sized chunks!</li>
        <li>120ml soy milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up and stumble towards the kitchen,</li>
        <li>Combine muesli ingredients in your breakfast bowl. Bonus points if you washed and cut the fruit first! It is not a contest?!? Oh well.</li>
        <li>Profit.</li>
    </ol>
